VFold API library
=============

A project still in development with great potential for bringing developers together to create and customize their own set of application components (Folders, Widgets, Tools and Desktops)

Features:
-------

* ### WebGL enabled
 
    A custom graphics engine implemented in the vfold platform for a great performance increase.

* ### Your Components

    There is a nice API for you to develop your components quickly and easily. The library is still lacking, but more work to come!

* ### Workspaces

    A container of all defined components belonging to it. In workspaces, you keep things tidy.

* ### The Dashboard

    VFOLD's default workspace for viewing and managing your entire platform. There is work yet to come on this area. Still in early development stage.
